</p>

- **Description**: Users are assigned roles (such as viewer, editor, or admin) with specific permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can modify or view certain documents.
- **How It Works**: Each user is assigned a role during login, and their access rights are enforced through both frontend checks and backend policies, ensuring data security and proper workflow management.

### **Architecture**
The app uses **React.js** for a responsive, real-time front-end experience, while **Node.js** and **WebSockets** provide the back-end communication layer for real-time interactions. Data is stored in **PostgreSQL**, with **Redis** used to manage real-time sessions and updates.

#### **Core Components**:
- **React.js**: Delivers a real-time user interface, updating document changes and chat messages instantly.
- **Node.js**: Manages real-time connections using WebSockets, processing document changes and chat messages.
- **WebSockets**: Facilitates low-latency communication between users and the server.
- **Redis**: Manages session persistence for real-time document collaboration.

### **Challenges Solved**
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Provided a seamless, low-latency experience for collaborative document editing using WebSockets.
- **Concurrent Editing**: Solved issues related to multiple users editing the same document by implementing conflict resolution mechanisms.
- **Security**: Implemented role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users could edit or view specific documents.

### **Impact**
- Increased team productivity by **35%** through seamless real-time collaboration.
- Supported over **1,000 concurrent users** with minimal latency.
- Reduced document conflicts by **20%** with real-time conflict resolution mechanisms.
